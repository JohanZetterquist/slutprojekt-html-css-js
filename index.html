			<p>An unprecedented chance to live your own deep space adventure! Star Citizen places you in the middle of a living, breathing science fiction universe populated with friends, enemies and the unknown.
			You decide how to make your way in the galaxy, whether you’re a simple merchant trader, a fearsome pirate or a badass mercenary… and anything in-between.In Star Citizen, you control your destiny as you inhabit a world with an unparalleled level of immersion.
			</p>
			<p>Star Citizen’s ships don’t just look good, they fly in accordance with a detailed Newtonian physics 
			engine! The game offers a full rigid body simulation of all spacecraft; if it flies in Star Citizen, we’ve 
			figured out exactly how and why.The game features numerous built-in flight models that will let you treat your ship like a traditional space combat game… or break the mold and pull off maneuvers that should only be possible in zero G!
			</p>
			<p>Don’t rocket into the unknown by yourself: Star Citizen features an array of multi-crew ships that teams of players can operate together. Imagine yelling “fighters inbound, on our six!” to your turret gunner, as your chief engineer desperately tries to keep your fusion engine together.
			From small freighters to luxury star yachts to military warships, there’s a larger ship for every role and a role for every player. Whether you’re an aspiring pilot, gunner, engineer, medic, navigator or any of a dozen other optional crew positions, you can join with your friends and take on the universe!
